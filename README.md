It simulates real-time occupancy grid generation and ESDF propagation on 2.5D slices, supporting modular integration into higher-level planning frameworks such as A\*, RRT\*, or kinodynamic sampling-based methods. ## Features - üí° Minimalistic 3D voxel map representation with efficient memory layout - üîß Modular architecture for ESDF update cycles and obstacle injection - üñºÔ∏è Visualization via `numpy` + `PIL` to render signed distance field slices - üì¶ Designed for fast prototyping, supports batch experiments for distance transform accuracy ## Applications - Autonomous ground/aerial robotics (as mapping front-end) - Validation of ESDF-based planning algorithms under voxel constraints - Teaching, research, or interview demonstration of spatial map construction </code></pre>
